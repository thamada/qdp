abstract = "The recent commodity hardware, such as the Cell processor in PLAYSTATION 3 or GeForce GTX280 GPU, has much more peak performance in single-precision than that of CPU of PCs, while the double-precision performance of these computers is comparable to it. Even though a quasi double-precision method achieves comparable accuracy to double-precision, the performance of it is relatively low. In this paper, the quasi double-precision method is modified, and it can deliver more performance than that by native double-precision of the GPU. Calculation of a Mandelbrot set and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are used to test the method.",
